## Credits
This project was originally inspired by [Adiseshuâ€™s AI Model Testing project](https://github.com/Adiseshu-SDET/ai-model-testing).  
I extended it by adding:
- PyTest-based automated test suite (data, functional, behavioral, fairness).  
- Negative and edge-case testing.  
- Allure and HTML reporting.  
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.  

This repository extends the original project by improving the testing framework and adding QA-focused features.

## My Contributions
- Designed comprehensive PyTest test suite.  
- Added behavioral and fairness tests.  
- Integrated Allure/HTML reporting for test results.  
- Configured CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
